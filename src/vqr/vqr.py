    Given a sample x of shape (1, k), the conditional d-dimensional vector quantiles
    Y|X=x are given by d/du [ B @ x.T  + A ].
    We first calculate the regression targets Y_hat = B @ x.T  + A.

    In order to obtain the d vector quantile surfaces (one for each dimension of Y),
    use the :obj:`decode_quantile_values` function on Y_hat.
    These surfaces can be visualized over the grid defined in U.
    The combination of these surfaces comprise the conditional quantile function,
    Q_{Y|X=x}(u) which has a d-dimensional input and output.
